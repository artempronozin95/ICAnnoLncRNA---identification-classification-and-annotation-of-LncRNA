# ICAnnoLncRNA - identification, classification and annotation of LncRNA
Pipeline for automatic identification, classification and annotation of plant lncRNAs based on their localization in the genome.
## Before work start, create environment:
    1. Open folder env
    2. conda env create --file env/programs.yaml
    3. conda activate pipeline
After these steps all necessary packages are installed. If you need update packages (not recommended), change the version of  packages after “=” (example - snakemake=4.0.1 -> snakemake=6.0.0), then “conda env update --file env/programs.yaml”. All necessary packages will be updated.
